# C++ Modules – 42 School

This repository contains all the C++ modules completed as part of the common core at École 42. Each module tackles different aspects of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, gradually introducing more complex and powerful features of the language.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The main goals of these modules are to:

- Strengthen object-oriented programming skills in C++
- Understand memory management, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Learn about operator overloading, templates, and type casting
- Write clean, modular, and maintainable C++ code
- Practice compiling and organizing code using Makefiles

## 📦 Modules Overview

### ✅ Module 00 – C++ Basics
- Basic syntax, classes, private/public members
- Member functions, constructors/destructors
- Canonical form

### ✅ Module 01 – Memory Allocation & References
- Static vs dynamic memory
- Pointers and references
- Shallow vs deep copies

### ✅ Module 02 – Inheritance
- Simple inheritance
- Operator overloading

### ✅ Module 03 – Multiple Inheritance & Diamond Problem
- Virtual inheritance
- Constructor and destructor chaining

### ✅ Module 04 – Polymorphism
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Virtual functions and dynamic dispatch

### ✅ Module 05 – Operator Overloading & Canonical Form
- Overloading assignment and comparison operators
- Proper copy constructors and destructors

### ✅ Module 06 – Type Casting
- `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`
- Safe type conversions and memory interpretation

### ✅ Module 07 – Templates
- Function and class templates
- Generic programming principles

### ✅ Module 08 – Standard Containers & Iterators
- Introduction to STL-like containers
- Iterator design and implementation

### ✅ Module 09 – Interface & I/O

## ⚙️ Build Instructions

Each module comes with a Makefile. To compile:

```bash
make
